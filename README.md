# avocadoo

avocadoo is a Google Chrome extension.

avocadoo is an internal tool for Odooers. It adds a link within the Database Information page that directs you to the `_odoo/support` page. It helps you impersonate a customer's database faster, since you won't have to copy the database URL and append /_odoo/support at the end.

The new link will be displayed next to the URL field in the Database Information Page. The URL field will look like this:

`URL   https://example.odoo.com/`   [/_odoo/support](#)

Now you can click the /_odoo/support link next to the URL and a new browser tab will be opened with the login page to inpersonate that database! You can also right-click the link and open the URL on an incognito window.

## How to Install

1. Download the code of this extension as a ZIP file.
2. Unzip the downloaded file. A folder called "avocadoo" will now be present in your computer.
3. In Google Chrome, open the menu (icon of the 3 dots to the top right of the window). Then navigate to "More tools" and then select "Extensions". The Extensions control panel will be displayed.
4. Enable Developer Mode (switch at the top right corner of the Extensions control panel). This will display the buttons for step 5.
5. Click the button "Load unpacked".
6. Find the unzip folder from Step 2. It should be called "avocadoo".
7. The avocadoo extension should now be installed. Make sure it is active.
8. You might have to open a new odoo.com tab or refresh the current one to start seing the /_odoo/support link.

I hope avocadoo saves you some time!
